Your raw score is the total number of points you receive from the AP Minecraft Kahoot.
With Kahoot, a maximum of 1,000 points is awarded per question, with faster responses
receiving more points than slower ones. Incorrect responses or omitted questions earn
zero points. Then, your score (out of 45,000) will be converted to an AP score (out of 5)
through an equating process.
